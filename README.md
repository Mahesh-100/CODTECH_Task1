1. Introduction:
2. 
The Calculator program is a simple Java application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as exponentiation.
It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input numbers and select the desired operation. Additionally, the program includes error handling to prevent division by zero.

3. Installation:
   
To run the Calculator program:
1.Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2.Download the Calculator.java file.
3.Open a command prompt or terminal.
4.Navigate to the directory containing the Calculator.java file.
5.Compile the program using the command: 'javac SimpleCalculator.java'
6.Run the program using the command: 'java SimpleCalculator'

5. Code Explanation:
   
Main Class: SimpleCalculator
The main class Calculator controls the flow of the program. It includes a main method where user interactions are handled using a Scanner object.
Arithmetic Operations:
Each arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation) is implemented within a switch-case statement. 
User input is taken for the numbers involved in the operation, and the result is calculated accordingly.
Quit Option:
The program includes an option to quit, which terminates the program loop when selected by the user.
